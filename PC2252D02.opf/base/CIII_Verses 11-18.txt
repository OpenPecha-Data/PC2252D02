12 (337, 1st part). Therefore as many as are here come together; this salutary word I tell unto
you: Pull up the weed of lust by the root as one does the (birana) grass for the sake
of the uçira (root).

13 (337, 2nd part). They who are given to the company of lustfulness wander about for a long
time; so pull up lust by the root, and sorrow and fear are no more.14 (341). Again and again
seeking for it (existence), they again and again enter the womb; beings come and go; to
one state of being succeeds another.

15. It is hard to cast off (existence) in this world; he who has cast off lust, who has pulled
up the seed (of existence), will no more be subject to transmigration, for he has put an
end to lust.

16. Care not about abiding in the conditions of humanity, which hold one captive among gods
and men, but cross over from the regions of lust. If one is born in hell, the human condition
(dal-hbyor) is at an end, and one repents him (of his mistake).

17 (340). The channels of lust are the source (of transmigration). Lust in (this) world is the
root of the vine, which creeps up and entwines one as in the folds of a net. If one does
not destroy this tormentor, he will be subject to ever-recurring suffering, and will never
leave it entirely behind.

18 (338). As long as a live tree has not been pulled up by the roots, but only cut down, it
springs up afresh; so it is that if even the smallest atom of lust has not been eradicated,
one will not leave behind this ever-recurring suffering (i.e., existence).

19. As he who has himself made a weapon is killed by it when in the robber’s hands, so likewise
the being in whose heart lust has arisen will be killed by it.

20. Knowing then the sufferings that come from lust and its punishment: having cast off lust,
without eagerness for anything, the reflective Bhixu has departed entirely (from this world).
