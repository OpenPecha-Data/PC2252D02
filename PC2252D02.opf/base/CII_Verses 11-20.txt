11. As the shoemaker, when he has well prepared his leather, can use it to make shoes, so when
one has cast off desires, he has the highest happiness.

12. If one longs for happiness, let him cast off all desires; he who has cast off all desires
will find the most perfect happiness.

13. As long as one follows after desire, one finds no satisfaction ; they who through wisdom
have given it up find contentment.

14. Desires are never satiated; wisdom affords contentment : he who has the contentment of wisdom
cannot fall into the power of lust.

15. They who have fondness for pleasure, and who delight only in what is wrong: would not perceive
the danger they run, even if their life were drawing to a close.

16. The evil-minded is subdued by wealth and seeks not after the other world; his mind is subverted
by his fondness for desires; he brings destruction on himself and on others.

17 (186). Even a shower of Karqçapanas would not satisfy the covetous; the wise know full well
that desires bring little contentment and (much) pain.

18 (187). Not even in the pleasures of the gods does the disciple of the perfect Buddha find
pleasure; he rejoices only in the destruction of desires.

19. Even a mountain of riches like unto Himavat would not suffice for the wealth of a single
man; he who has understanding knows this full well.

20. They who know that this (i.e., desire) is the origin of sorrow, how can they delight in
pleasures? Having learnt that this is the cause of pain in the world, they acquire steadfastness
to help to control themselves.
