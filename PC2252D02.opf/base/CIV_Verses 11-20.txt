11. He who is not given up to carelessness, who finds no delight in pleasures, whose mind is
always attentive, will put an end to sorrow.

12. He who has put an end to sorrow, and is not given to carelessness in this world, can no
more be hurt by the careless than can the lion by the antelope.

13 (309). The shameless man who covets his neighbour’s wife will experience these four conditions:
he acquires @ad) reputation, troubled sleep, thirdly scorn, and fourthly he goes to
hell.

14 (310). He who, acting not virtuously, doeth evil, indulges but for a moment, amidst fear
and trembling, his burning passion, and then he has to bear the heavy punishment of the king,
and he is burnt in hell.

15. He who seeks after happiness, let him act vigorously; the steadfast makes no slothful exertions
like those of the foolish waggoners.

16.When the fools with their waggons have given up the highroad and have entered a bad road,
they deeply grieve over their mistake.

17. In like manner, the fool who gives up the law and follows that which is not the law falls
into the power of the lord of death; he also is destroyed by reason of his want of sight.

18. They who do not what ought to be done, and who do that which ought not to be done, who glory
in their carelessness, increase the extent of their troubles, and he who adds to his
misery finds its cessation a long way off..

19. He who comprehends the nature of the body, who reflects, and whose exertions are unceasing,
does not what ought sot to be done, and does what ought to be done.20. He, therefore,
with memory and understanding will put an end to his misery, and when he has put an end to
his misery (âsrava), he will find the untroubled state.
