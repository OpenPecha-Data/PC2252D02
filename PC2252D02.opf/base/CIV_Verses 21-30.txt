21. As many as you be, I declare unto you that those who, though they have heard but little
of the law, have followed its commandments, have understood the law; they who follow the law
have understood the law.

22 (19). Even if the careless man can recite a large portion (of the lam), he follows it not;
he is like a cowherd counting the cattle of others; he has no share in the priesthood?

23 (20). He who, though he can only recite a few lines (of the law), walks in the path of the
law, and has forsaken passion, anger, and ignorance, he has a share in the priesthood.

24. He whose speech exalts earnestness and who always despises heedlessness will be greater
among the gods than he who has made a hundred sacrifices.

25. The sage who praises earnestness in his speech knows what is right and what is wrong; the
sage holds fast to earnestness for two reasons:

for the blessings it brings this life, and also on account of the future; the steadfast who
have understood this are called sages.

26 (327). The Bhixu who delights in purity and who looks with dread on impurity will pull himself
from out the evil way as the elephant pulls himself from out the mire.

27. The Bhixu who delights in purity and who looks with dread on impurity shakes off sin as
does the wind the leaves of a tree.

28. The Bhixu who delights in purity and who looks with dread on impurity puts an end to all
attachments and gradually arrives at felicity.
