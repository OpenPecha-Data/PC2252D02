11 (136). The fool sees not that his evil deeds, when they shall have matured, will still be
burning. Hereafter his deeds will torment him as if burnt by fire.

12 (66). The fool of little understanding treats himself as he would an enemy; he does evil
deeds which will bear burning fruit.

13 (67). The deed which harms, and of which the reward is received with tears and a downcast
face, that deed is not well done.

14 (68). The deed which harms not, and of which the reward is received with joy and happiness,
that deed is well done.

15 (69). When a man in the pursuit of his pleasure accomplishes an evil deed, it brings smiles
to his face; but when his evil deed has ripened, it brings him sorrow.

16 (71). Surely an evil deed does not turn on a sudden like milk;3 it is like fire smouldering
in the ashes, which burns the fool.

17. An evil deed kills not instantly, as does a sword, but it follows the evil-doer (even) into
the next world.

18. How burning is (an evil deed) when it has arrived at maturity, the evil-doers will find
out in the other world.

19 (240). As iron, when the rust doth take hold of it, is eaten by it, so in like manner is
the heedless man brought into the evil way by his own deed.
