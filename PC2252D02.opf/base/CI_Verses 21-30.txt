21. It is the law of humanity that, though one acquires hundreds and thousands of worldly goods,
one still falls into the power of the lord of death.

22. The end of all that has been hoarded up is to be spent; the end of what has been lifted
up is to be cast down; the end of meeting is separation; the end of life is death.

23. As the end of life is death, and all creatures do die, so likewise do virtue and vice bear
fruits which follow after the deeds.

24 (126). They who do evil go to hell; 1 they who are virtuous go to happiness; they who have
observed the right way and are without sin obtain nirvāṇa.

25. The Buddhas, the pratyeka Buddhas, and the disciples of the Buddhas cast off this body;
what is the use of speaking of the ignorant crowd?

26. There is no place where is not the pain of death, not in the sky nor in the midst of the
sea, not even if one enters into the clefts of the mountains.

27. All who have been and all who shall be, abandon this body and depart; the wise man who understands
that (the body) is to be dreaded, lives a life of purity according to the Law.

28. Seeing old age, the pain of disease, and the death of the heedless, he who is earnest gives
up a home that is like a prison; 6 but how can the common of mortals cast off desires?

29 (151). Even the brilliant chariot of the king is destroyed, the body also draws nigh to old
age; but the best of men: who teaches others this best of all good laws, shall not know
old age.

30. Thou art foolish and despicable? and doest not that which is right; for that body (rūpa)
in which thou delights will be the cause of thy ruin.
