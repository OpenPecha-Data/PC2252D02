31. One may live a hundred years, yet he is subject to the lord of death; one may reach old
age, or else he is carried off by disease.

32. He who is (always) changing without ceasing, decaying day and night, filled with the anguish
of birth and death, is like the fish thrown in hot water.

33. This life is fleeting away day and night; it is unstable like the stream of a great river;
one goes on not to return again?

34. Man is like a fish in a shallow pool of water; day and night this life is passing away;
what subject of rejoicing is there in so brief a thing?

35 (148). The end of life is death; this body bent down by age, this receptacle of disease,
is rapidly wasting away; this mass of corruption will soon be destroyed.

36 (41). Alas! this body will soon lie on the earth unnoticed, empty: senseless, thrown away
in a cemetery like a billet of wood.

37. Continually afflicted by disease, always emitting some impurity, this body, undermined by
age and death, what is the use of it?

38 (286). " This (abode) will do for winter and (this) for summer;" thus ponders the rapidly
decaying fool who has not seen the danger.

39 (288). Thou who art surrounded by children and flocks, children are no refuge, nor are father,
mother, and kinsfolk; thou art without a refuge!
