and to go to the abode of happiness in the other world, watches well his conduck

2. The sage, besides these objects, watches well his conduct for the sake of acquiring saintliness,
most perfect sight: and worldly peace.

3. Morality brings happiness; the body is free from pain; at night one’s rest is peaceful, and
on awakening one is still happy.4. The wise, who are charitable, and who observe the (other)
moral precepts, acquire by the merit of charity endless happiness in this world and
in the other.

5. It is well for him who observes, even unto old age, morality and virtue and who is a believer:
wisdom is the greatest treasure of man; it would be hard indeed for a robber to steal
away the merit (of one’s good works).

6-7. The Bhixu who observes the moral laws: whose senses are controlled, who is sober in his
food, who gives not himself up to sleep; he who is thus diligent, who is never lazy day and
night, is so near nirvâṇa that he cannot possibly fail (to reach it).

8. Observing the moral laws, his mind and understanding diligent in meditation, by such a life
will the Bhixu arrive at the destruction of misery.

9. He consequently who is careful to observe the moral laws and meditation will acquire supernatural
sight and discriminate according to knowledge.

10. Then he will, having destroyed all his attachments: enfranchised his mind, be separated
from all things, and, possessed of knowledge, he goes beyond an incalculable quantity of sorrows.

11. He who devotes himself to these three things, morality, meditation, and knowledge, arrives
finally at perfect purity, and puts an end to pain and also to existence.
