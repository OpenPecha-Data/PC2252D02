22. So likewise he who has been virtuous: on arriving from this world into another, his good
works receive him like kinsfolk and welcome him.

23. Lay up, therefore, good works in view of the other world; for it is good works that receive
beings in the other world.

24. He whose life is one of virtue is praised by the gods; he in whom there is nothing to be
blamed finds perfect joy in heaven.

25. He who observes the law, who is perfectly virtuous, modest, speaking the truth, doing what
he ought to do, delights the rest of mankind.

26. He who, doing what he ought to do, and who, extolling the true law, gives to others pleasure,
shall find joy in the other world.

27. His speech is edifying, and he has given up all wrong doings, in this delights the righteous,
and delights not the unrighteous.

28. Therefore what is good and what is not good are separated at death; the unrighteous go to
hell, the righteous go to heaven?
