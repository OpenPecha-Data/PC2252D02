1. As the she-mule (dies) on account of her offspring, as the reed and the plantain decay on
bearing fruit, so likewise is the foolish man destroyed by honors.

2 (72). No matter how long the fool sacrifices, he will not cease from being infatuated; the
fool’s bright lot goes on decreasing until it brings to sorrow even the crown of his head.

3 (73). The fool wishes for riches, for the subjection of the Bhixus (to his orders), for lordship
in the abode (of the clergy), to receive the homages of other people.

4 (74). " Let both priests and laymen, whosoever they may be, imagine that it is I (who have
done it); in whatever is to be done or not done, let them be subject to me; " such is the
mind of the fool, and his desires greatly increase?

5 (75). One is the way to wealth, another is the road to nirvâṇa; if the Bhixu, the disciple
of the Buddha, has learnt this, he finds no pleasure in honours, but seeks after perfect
seclusion (from the world).

6. Retain no fondness for anything; deceive no man; give up any occupation; in (following) the
law one must not be engaged in commerce.

7. Look after what is to your own profit and envy not what is to that of another, for the Bhixu
who does envy another cannot find tranquillity (samâdhi).

8. If a Çramana aspires to lead a happy life, let him put on the gown (sanghâti) of the priesthood
and receive alms of food and drink.9. If a Çramana aspires to lead a happy life, let
him keep to a dwelling-place (of the priesthood), as the reptile does to the rat’s hole.1

10. If a Çramana aspires to lead a happy life, let him be contented with the meanest things:
and think only of the greatest of laws.
