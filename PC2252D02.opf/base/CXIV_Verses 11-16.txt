11 (5). He who shows hatred to those who hate will never be at peace; he who is patient with
those who hate will find peace; this is the spirit of religion.

12. He who bears ill-will to those who bear ill-will can never become pure; but he who feels
no ill-will, pacifies them who hate: as hatred brings misery to mankind, the sage knows no
hatred.

13. If a man find a wise companion: who is both steadfast and pure, let him, having overcome
all corruption, associate with him, thoughtful and glad.

14 (329). If a man find not a wise companion, who is both steadfast and pure, like a king abandoning
his broad kingdom: let him live alone and commit no sin.

15 (61). If a man find not a good friend who leads a life like unto his own, let him resolutely
keep a solitary life, and not associate with a fool.

16 (330). It is better to live a lonely life than to have companionship with the fool; casting
off all taxation of mind, one lives alone, like the elephant of the MÃ¢tanga forest.
