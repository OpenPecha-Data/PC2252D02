1. IT is the teaching of the Buddha, that whoever (commences by) reflecting on the operation
of breathing, and who goes on through the different stages (of meditation), his mind well
composed, will reach perfection, as the sun and moon, when free from clouds, illuminate the
whole world.

2. He who, standing, sitting, and sleeping, keeps both body and mind under control, such a thoughtful
and well-controlled Bhixu will find the above-mentioned and other blessings; and
if he has obtained the above-mentioned and the other blessings, he will not go to where is
the lord of death.

3. He who continually reflects on what appertains to the body, and has well under control the
six senses (8yntanas), and who is always well composed, knows the extinction of sorrow.

4. He who continually reflects on what appertains to the body in all its different shapes, on
being without self, without attachment for the "mine," will not care for self; he will have
no attachment for the "mine: " in this manner will the Bhixu swiftly cross over from the
regions of desire.

5. He who is thoughtful, wise, well composed, happy: and pure, and who attends carefully at
all times to this law, will, I declare, cross over from birth and old age.

6. Thus learning to be always on his guard, the wise, thoughtful, and diligent Bhixu, after
having cast off all bonds, finds by this means the destruction of sorrow (nirvâṇa).

7. They who are awake can watch better than they who sleep, I tell you; it is better to watch
than to sleep, for he who watches has no fear.

8. He who is watchful and diligent is safe day and night, and he mill find the end of pain (kleçâ)
in the longed-for cessation of death (nirvâṇa).

9. They who day and night are reflecting on the Buddha, and who go to the Buddha for a refuge,
these men have the profits of mankind.

10. They who day and night are reflecting on the law (dharma), and who go to the law for a refuge,
these men have the profits of mankind.
