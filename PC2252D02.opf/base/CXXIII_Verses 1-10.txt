1. LEARN what has been well explained, associate only with Çramanas: (live) in seclusion and
with only a single mat, and thy mind will be at rest.

2. Re who has but a single mat, one resting-place (the earth?), who is without indolence, who
dwells alone in a forest, he will learn to control himself.

3 (103). He who conquers a thousand times a thousand men in battle, a greater conqueror than
he is he who conquers himself.

4 (104). He who by continual control has conquered himself has by this one conquest gained so
great a victory that that over the rest of mankind could not add to it.

5 (105). The Bhixu who has conquered through knowledge, Mâra and Brahmâ cannot defeat him, nor
can a Deva or a Gandharva.

6 (158). If one in the first place has done that which is right, he can afterwards discipline
others to be like himself; if one in the first place has done that which is right, afterwards
the wise man and those he shall have disciplined will be free from suffering.

7. If a man make others as he has made himself, then, being subdued and at rest, he can educate
others to be happy.

8. If a man would make others as he has made himself, ah! let yourself be well subdued, for
it is difficult to subdue one’s self.

9 (166). One must give up what is beneficial to the multitude for what is for one’s own good;
when one has found that which is so greatly beneficial to himself, let him make his own
welfare his chief concern.
