1. To listen attentively, to live righteously, to give up a home for a state of happiness: to
consent to give up all, these are alike praiseworthy in a Çramana.

2. The fool, who knows not, behaves as if he was immortal ; the wise man applies himself day
and night to the holy law.

3-4 If a person:enters into a house wrapped in darkness, though he has eyes he cannot see objects
that are (in it);

so likewise though a man is well born and has intelligence, if he hears not the law of vice
and of virtue he cannot have wisdom.

5. Like a man who, having eyes and who bearing also a lamp, sees all objects, is he who has
heard the law of vice and of virtue; he will become perfectly wise.

6. They who hearken acquire knowledge of the law; they who hearken turn away from sin; they
who hearken give up all evil-doers; they who hearken find nirvâṇa.

7. If one has heard much but observes not the moral laws (çīla), he, because he disdains the
moral laws, is not the best kind of hearer.

8. If one has heard little but does carefully observe the moral laws, he, because he honours
the moral laws, is the best kind of hearer.

9. He who listens but little and he who observes not the moral laws, both of these, by reason
of their disrespectfulness, lead not the best of lives.

10. He who has heard and he who carefully observes the moral laws, both of these, by reason
of their reverence, lead the best of lives.
