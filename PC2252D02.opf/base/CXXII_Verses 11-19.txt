11. They who have heard much and who understand the law, who are wise and well composed, no
one can scorn them, for they are like a jewel of gold of Djambudvipa.

12. He who describes me in his speech, having judged me (only) by outward appearance (lit. form),
that man is held by lust and does not know me.

13. If one has a thorough knowledge of the inner (qualities of the Buddha), but has not seen
the outer (perfections of his person), let him, having perceived the inner fruits, be candid
in his language.

14. If one has seen the outer (perfections of the Buddha); but has not a knowledge of the inner
(qualities of his doctrine), let him, having perceived the apparent fruit: be candid in
his language.

15. If one has no knowledge of the inner (qualities), and has not perceived the outer (perfections
of my person), a fool in utter darkness, let him be candid in his language.

16. If one has a thorough knowledge of the inner (qualities), and has seen the outer (perfections),
a sage who knows the way to salvation, let him be candid in his language.

17. Though the ear hears much and the eye sees many things, all they who do hear and see the
doctrine, do not believe.

18. Though a man has inwardly digested the well-spoken words he has heard, and has acquired
the essence of meditation, if he acts corruptly his hearing and understanding will avail him
nothing.

19. They who delight in the law taught by the elect, who follow it in body and speech, who delight
in the society of the patient, who control their senses, they will obtain the reward
of hearing and of understanding.
