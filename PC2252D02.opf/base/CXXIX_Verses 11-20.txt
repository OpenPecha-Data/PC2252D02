11. He who in this world, not being well controlled, deceitfully, for some interested motive,
produces the incorrect idea that he is well controlled by the general appearance of his
garb (lit. colour and person), no confidence must be placed in him.

12. As deceiving as the colour of brass, like iron coated over with gold is he whose inside
is poison, and whose outward manner is that of the elect, and who goes about in this world
with a great company.

13 (325). He who is given to gourmandising, to sleeping, to going about day and night seeking
for a place to lie down in, like a great hog (wallowing) in the mire, this man will be reborn
again and again.

14. The man who is always thoughtful, who knows how to be always moderate in his food, he is
subject to but little suffering: and his slow digestion prolongs his life?

15 (7). He whose senses are not controlled, who does not know how to be moderate in his food,
who is thoughtless and idle, who lives seeking what pleases (the eye): is overthrown by
his passions as is a weak tree by the wind.

16 (8). He whose senses are well controlled, who knows how to be moderate in his food, who remembers
everything and is diligent, who seeks not after what pleases (the eye), is not disturbed
by passions, like a mountain unshaken by the wind.

17 (99). The forest is delightful, where man finds no delight; there the passionless finds delight,
for he seeks not after pleasures.

18 (98). In a forest or in a village, on a mountain top or in a valley: in whatever part of
the earth an Ariya dwells, that (spot) is agreeable.

19 (304). The holy shine from afar off, like the snowy mountains ; the wicked shine not, even
though near, like arrows shot in intense darkness.

20. If one associates with the wise, with the holy whose minds are turned to virtue, he obtains
great profit, and acquires profound wisdom.
