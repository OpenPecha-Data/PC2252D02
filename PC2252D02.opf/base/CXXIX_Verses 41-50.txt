44. He who has done that which is wrong, suffers for it, and when hereafter he will be in the
evil way he will suffer; he who has done that which is right, is made happy, and when hereafter
he will be in the happy way he will be happy.

45. It is better in both (this world and the other) if one has not done evil, for he who does
it will suffer; it is good for one to do what is right, for he will have no affliction.

46. The wise man and the fool being mixed together, it is not possible to distinguish them when
they have not spoken; but let one of them impart (the way) to the perfection of peace
(nirvâṇa), then he is known by his speech (to be a sage).

47. The expounding (of the law) is the standard of the Rischi (i.e., Bhagavat); the law being
the standard of the Rischi, and the law by his explanations being made brilliant, let the
Rischi raise on high his standard.

48 (227). If one has not spoken he is blamed; if one has spoken much he is blamed; he who speaks
slowly is blamed: there is no one in the world who is not blamed.

49 (228). A man who is only to be blamed, or one who is only to be praised, there is none such;
there never has been, there never will be.50. They who preoccupy not themselves about
existence, who have put an end to all return of suffering from attachment, and are delivered
of existence, gods and men cannot understand their purpose?

51 (229, 230). He who is praised by those who have discriminative knowledge, as being faithful,
virtuous, and of great wisdom, there is no one who can blame him; he is like a jewel of
Djambudvipa gold.

52 (81). As mountains and rocks are unshaken by the wind, so likewise the wise man is unmoved
by praise or blame.53. The earnest man without any root in the earth, without a leaf (of
sinfulness) on any branch, delivered from bondage, there is no one who can blame him.
