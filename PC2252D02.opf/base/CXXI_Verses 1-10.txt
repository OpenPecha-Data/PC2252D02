1. In this world I know all, I have conquered all, I am free from all conditions (dharma), I
have cast away everything; having put an end to all desires; perfectly emancipated, manifestly
wise, by whom can I be taught?

2. I am the Tathâgata, the highest teacher; I am almighty, omniscient, and have obtained perfect
wisdom (bodhi), which I fathomed by myself; incomparable and unequalled, by whom can
I be taught?

3. I am the Arhat of the world; in this world I am unequalled ; (alone) among gods and men I
have conquered the hosts of Mâra.

As there is none other like me, no one can be my master; all alone in the world I have found
perfect and unsurpassable wisdom (samyaksambodhi).

4. I have found the cessation of the âsravas; like unto me are (all) Djinas, who have found
this out. I have overcome all states of sinfulness, therefore am I a Djina?5. As I am the
conqueror of all that is like (sin), I the all-wise, perfectly enlightened one, who have crossed
over from the region of desire, I who have attained nirvâṇa, I am not to be taught
by any one in the world.

6. I am going to Vâraṇasi to sound the Drum of the Law for those who until now have known naught
of it, to turn the Wheel of the Law that has been turned by no one in the world.

7. The mighty Tathâgatas do instruct here by the law; they who have learnt the lam, there is
no one that can look down on them.

8. Both gods and men delight in him who is steadfast, who is given to meditation, delighting
in the peace of salvation, who has reached the end of corporeal existence: who is Perfectly
Enlightened, glorious, and who is in the enjoyment of Wisdom (pradjnâ).
