9. They who have been Buddhas, the future Buddhas, and the present perfect Buddha, do liberate
(mankind) from many sorrows.

To reverence the law, for all those who have been, who are, and who shall be, this is the great
law of all Perfectly Enlightened ones.

He, therefore, who in this world cares about himself, and who wishes to arrive at greatness,
let him remember the commandment of the Buddhas and reverence the law.

10. The man who has no faith in the doctrine of the Buddha is a fool; he will finally come to
grief, as did the merchants with the Râkshasîs (female demons).

11. The man who has faith in the doctrine of the Buddha, and who is wise, will arrive at felicity
in the other world, like the merchants (carried off) by "Might of a Cloud."

12. It is by perfect understanding of happiness and of the value of seclusion, and by living
according to both of these, that the unequalled and incomparable Tathâgatas, the perfectly
enlightened, dispel darkness, pass over to the other side, and acquire glory (among men).

13. Their minds all-powerful by having obtained what was to be obtained, perfectly free, having
put an end to the âsravas, completely emancipated, mercifully longing to deliver (mankind),
without wickedness or âsrava, they show the beings of the universe what is beneficial
to them.

14-15. They who are on the summit of a mountain can see all men; in like manner they who are
intelligent and free from sorrow are enabled to ascend above the paradise of the gods; and
when they there have seen the subjection of man to birth and death and the sorrows by which
he is afflicted, they open the doors of the immortal. Let those who will listen free themselves
of all distrustfuness.
