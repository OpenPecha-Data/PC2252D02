21 (117). He who has laid up for himself the miseries of sin will find no joy; even if a man
has done-evil a hundred times, let him not do it again.

22. He who has laid up for himself the felicity of virtue will find joy; if a man had done what
is virtuous, let him do it again.

23 (116). The mind (of that man) delights in evil who does what is right slothfully; keeping
his mind away from evil, he must hasten towards what is

24. He who has done even a little evil experiences in this world and in the other great ruin
and a great deal of suffering; it is like poison that has entered into the internal parts?

25. He who has done even a little good finds in this world and in the other happiness and great
profit; it is like a seed that has well taken root.

26 (137). He who inflicts pain on one who is sinless, who is angered with one who is without
anger, will speedily arrive himself at one of these ten states.27 (138). He will experience
no end of pain (vedan√¢), or he will be torn limb from limb, or he will experience a heavy
sensation of pain: or his mind will become deranged:

28 (139). Or he will be separated from his relatives, or he will lose his wealth, or he will
have some trouble with the king: or no end of disagreeable things:

29 (140). Or yet, again, his home will be destroyed by a great fire; and when the senseless
man has finished with this body he will go to hell.

30. He who has done what is evil cannot free himself of it; he may have done it long ago or
afar off: he may have done it in solitude, but he cannot cast it off, and when it has ripened
he cannot cast it off.
