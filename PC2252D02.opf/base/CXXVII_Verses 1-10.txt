1 (252). IT is easier to see the faults of others than those of oneself; the faults of others
are easily seen, for they are sifted like chaff, but oneâ€™s own faults are difficult to see.

It is like the cheat who shows the dice (of his adversary) and hides his own, calling attention
to the shortcomings of the other (player), and continually thinking of accusing him; he
is far from seeing what is right (dharma), and greatly increases is unhappy lot?

2 (244). Life is easy for an impudent, thieving boasting fellow, with filthy (instincts?) like
a crow; who leads a life of sinfulness and impudicity.

3 (245). Life is hard for the man who is always seeking what is pure, who is disinterested,
temperate, chaste, and modest.

4 (174). This world is in darkness; few there are who have [( 26,1)] spiritual insight? and
who, like birds escaped from a net, go to enjoy the heavens.

5. The fool who is held in bondage by his body is wrapped in darkness; they who covet worldly
goods consider all other things in this same (sinful) way.

6. Some think sentient beings are their own creators, some think that another (Isvara, &c.)
made them; they who take as the truth what is not the truth can see nothing at all; not seeing
that they are not even unanimous this point: they cannot perceive misery.

7. It enters not the mind of those beings who seek the pleasures of the senses that the misery
they have until then seen (brought on themselves) is their own work; they do not understand
that other like deeds will bring (misery also with them).

8. Those beings who are selfish, fond of selfishness, held in the bonds of selfishness, who
are given to controversial opinions: will not escape from the orb of transmigration.

9. Know that the (births) that one has been subject to, and those that he will be subject to,
all of these are wrapped in sinfulness (raga); they are subject to decay.
