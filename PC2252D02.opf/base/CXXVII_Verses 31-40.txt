28 (188). The common of men, driven by fear, seek a refuge in mountains, forests, groves, sacrificial
places, and in great trees.

29 (189). These are not the best of refuges, these are not the chief refuges, for a man who
goes to them for a refuge is not freed from all suffering.

30 (190). He who seeks a refuge in the Buddha, the law (dharma), and the church (sangha), (he
who sees with understanding) suffering, the production of suffering, the destruction of
suffering:

31 (191). He who sees with understanding happiness, the way to nirv창na, the eightfold holy way
and the four blessed truths:

32 (192). This is the chief refuge, this is the holy refuge; he who goes to this refuge becomes
freed from all suffering.

33. He who perceives (mentally) what he sees, can perceive also the unseen with his sight; he
who sees not the unseen does not perceive what he ought to see; ordinary sight and spiritual
insight (vipassan창) are by their nature as different as day and night, which never are
at the same time.

34. With ordinary sight one cannot perceive (suffering, &C.); if one sees, he loses sight of
form (rupa); with this sight (i.e., vipassan창) one perceives not form; with ordinary sight
one is without perceiving anything.

35. He who perceives nothing, sees (but) form; he who perceives, sees not form; thus they who
perceive not form have freed themselves of ordinary sight (i.e., have obtained vipassan창).

36. When one perceives not suffering, then he considers but the self (i.e., he has ordinary
sight); but when one distinguishes suffering, then he perceives not form.
