1. THE Bhixu who concentrates within himself all the faculties of his mind as the tortoise draws
its body into its shell) attached to nothing, injuring no one, does naught to impede
(the attaining of) nirvâṇa.

2 (184). Patience is the greatest penance; patience, the Buddha says, is the greatest nirvâṇa:
he who is a priest and who injures others, who harms others, is not a Çramana (lit. one
who practises virtue).

3 (133). Use no harsh words, for as one has been spoken to so will he answer; quarrelsome words
bring sorrow, they receive their punishment.

4. He who sends forth (evil-sounding words) like a bronze vase that has been struck, will suffer
for a long time, wandering about from birth to old age.

5 (134). He who does not send forth (evil-sounding words) like a bronze vase that has not been
struck, occasioning no quarrels, he will find nirvâṇa.

6. Absence of disease is the best of possessions, contentedness the beat of riches, a true friend
the best of friends, nirvâṇa the greatest happiness.

7 (203). All compound things (sanskâra) the greatest of pains, hunger the worst of diseases;
if one has found this out, he has found the highest nirvâṇa.

8. Let one but consider the way to attain happiness and the way to go to perdition, and when
he has thus formed an idea of sin, it will not be long ere he reaches nirvâṇa.

9. The way to attain happiness proceeds from a cause; the way to go to perdition has its cause;
the way to nirvâṇa has its cause; they all have a cause.

10. The deer go chiefly to the woods, the birds fly into the air; he who devotes himself to
the law goes to the nirvâṇa of the Arhat?
