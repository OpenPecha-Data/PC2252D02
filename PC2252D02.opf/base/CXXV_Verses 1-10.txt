1. THE wise man should not know him who is without faith, who is avaricious, who stirs up strife,
and who slanders; lie should not associate with the wicked.

2. The wise man should have as his friends those who have faith, who speak pleasingly, who are
attentive, virtuous, and wise; he should associate with the best of men.

3. Do not keep sinful persons as associates, stay not with the wicked; keep virtuous friends,
stay with righteous men. If one associates with such as these, he becomes not sinful, but
righteous.

4. Associate with them who have listened much, retained much, who reflect, who have faith and
wisdom; if one but hearken here to the pleasing words (of these men), he will attain that
which surpasses everything.

5. He who associates with what is low is contaminated by (their) sinfulness; he who associates
with what is entirely fallen is held down to earth; associating with what is best brings
one to righteousness. Keep then to those who will raise you to excellence.

6. If one associates with those best of men who are virtuous, dispassionate, who have the best
of knowledge, though one be good: one will arrive at still greater excellence.

7. I t is with him who associates with the sinful as with the sweet kuça grass in which a man
wrapped up some decayed fish; the kuça also became decayed.

8. I t is with him who associates with the virtuous as with the palâça leaves in which a man
wrapped up some incense (tagara); the leaves also became scented?

9. If those who are not wicked associate with the wicked, there arises an inclination to do
evil, which will grow into open acts of wickedness: by associating with those with whom one
ought not to associate, one becomes sinful through their sinfuness.

10. As when an arrow has been dipped in poison, even where the poison has not come in contact
with it, it is poisonous, so are those who are clothed in sin, that source of terror: keep
not wicked friends.
