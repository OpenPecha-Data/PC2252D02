21. The wise man cares not for fools, he makes not his friends of fools; for he who is fond
of the society of fools is led down to hel.

22 (63). If a fool says, "I am a fool," he is wise in that knowledge; but the fool who thinks
himself s wise man, he is called " a fool " (indeed).

23. When the fool doth praise and when the wise man doth scorn; the scorn of the wise man is
just, but improper is the praise of the foo.

24 (207). He who associates with a fool is in misery, as if he were with an enemy;2 one ought
not to associate with fools, neither ought one to listen to or see them; associating with
the steadfast is happiness, like meeting again one’s kinsfolk.

25 (208). Therefore, as the moon keeps to the path of the constellations, so likewise keep (only)
with them who are steadfast, erudite, who know what is best, virtuous, with the manners
of the elect (Ariyas), pre-eminent, kind, and intelligent.
