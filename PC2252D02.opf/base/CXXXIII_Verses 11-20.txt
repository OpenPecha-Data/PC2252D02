13. One does not become pure by washing, as do the common of mortals in this world; he who casts
away every sin both great and small, he, because he has cast away sins, is a Çramana,
a Brâhmana.

14. He who has cast off all sinfulness, who devotes himself to continual reflection, who has
the perfect enlightenment of the destruction of all attachment, he in the (three) worlds
is a Brâhmana. I[( 88,1)]

15. The Brâhmana who has cast off all sinfulness, who is without hypocrisy, and who leads a
pure life, has reached the perfection (set forth in) the Vedas; his life is a life of holiness
(brahmacharya), and when he does speak, his speech is holy.

16. He who is not given to deceiving, who is without selfishness, who is without passions, without
expectation, who has conquered hatred, who is on the way to nirvâṇa (the extinction
of sorrow), he is a Brâhmana, a Çramana, he is a Bhixu.

17 (396). He who has been born of woman, if he has great possessions, he may be called "Bhovadi,"
but I call him not a Brâhmana; he who possesses nothing, who accepts nothing, him I
call a Brâhmana.

18 (391). He who does nothing sinful in body, speech, and mind, who has the three parts well
controlled, he, I declare, is a Brâhmana.

19. He who uses not harsh words, who speaks what is right (true) and pleasing, who is without
sinfulness, he, I declare, is a Brâhmana.

20. He who patiently endures stripes,’ bonds, and abuse, in whose manner is patience, which
gives the strength of a host: he, I declare, is a Brâhmana.

21. He who is without anger, who observes the precepts, well-behaved, without desires, who has
now a body for the last time, lie, I declare, is a Brâhmana.

22. He who no longer dwells among either the clergy or the laity, who has few desires, who frequents
not houses, he, I declare, is a Brâhmana.
