55. He who has put an end to reviling, killing, hurting, and to the thorns of worldliness, who
is as immovable as a mountain, whom pleasure does not disturb, he is a Bhixu.

56. The Bhixu who does not revile or exaggerate: who perceives that this world is like a mirage,
casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off its old worn-out
skin.
