55. He who possesses a correct estimation of the mind, who appreciates the flavour of perfect
solitude, protected by the earnestness of his meditative mind, he enjoys the pleasure of
being without anything (that causes suffering).

56. He whose attentive mind delights in the truth and adheres to the (four) truths, who always
walks in the way with his body, he is safe in speech and in mind,2 and, casting off sorrow,
he will experience no more suffering.

57. He whose mind is not guarded, who is under the rule of false theories, subdued by sleep
and laziness, he will fall into the power of Mâra.

58. His mind therefore guarded, led by orthodox opinions, with perfect understanding in his
way of doing: perfectly comprehending birth and decay, the Bhixu, subduing sleep and laziness,
has found the way to put an end to suffering.

59. He who is pure is in safety; he whose mind is subdued and perfectly controlled is happy;
all those who have been led astray by brutish instincts will go to hell.

60. He who is pure is in safety; he whose mind is subdued and perfectly controlled is happy;
all those who have been led astray by brutish instincts will exist (hereafter) among beasts.

61. He who is pure is in safety; he whose mind is subdued and perfectly controlled is happy;
all those who have been led astray by brutish instincts will exist (hereafter) among pretas.

62. He who is pure is in safety; he whose mind is subdued and perfectly controlled is happy;
all those who are guarded against brutish instincts will find joy among men.

63. He who is pure is in safety; he whose mind is subdued and perfectly controlled is happy;
all those who are guarded against brutish instincts will find joy in heaven.

64. He who is pure is in safety; he whose mind is subdued and perfectly controlled is happy;
all those who are guarded against brutish instincts will find nirvâṇa?
