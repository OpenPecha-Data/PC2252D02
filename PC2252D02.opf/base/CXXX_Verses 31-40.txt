33. Worldly happiness and happiness in the region of the gods is not worth the sixteenth part
of the happiness (resulting) from the destruction of desires.

34. If one has been miserable under the weight of his burden: ’tis happiness to cast it down;
if one has cast down his heavy load, he will not in future take up another.

35. He who has put an end to all attachment, who has cast away all affection, who perfectly
understands all the skandhas, will not be subject to any subsequent existence.

36. To associate with those who bring one great profit is happiness; to be virtuous in the different
circumstances of life is happiness; to be satisfied with no matter how mean a pittance
is happiness; to put an end to all suffering is happiness.

37. By beating with a hammer the iron that has been burnt with fire it is finally destroyed;
in like manner is the unwise man done away with.

38. He who, having forded the miry stream of desire, has found the unchanging place (amatam
padam, nirvâna), there is nothing that will hold back that being who has (found) perfect emancipation.

39. He whom nothing agitates, who has left existence and not existence, free of terror, happy
and without sorrow, even the gods on seeing (his happiness) cannot comprehend its (extent).

40. In this world to hear much of the law and to comprehend it, nothing is so great a happiness!
Man is filled with love for his body, and see how little it takes to destroy it!

42. He who has understood that there is nothing commendable in the human condition, will have
the happiness of never being subject to birth; man is filled with love for his body, and
see how little it takes to destroy it!
