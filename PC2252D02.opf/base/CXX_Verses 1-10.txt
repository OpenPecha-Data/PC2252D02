1 (221). WHEN one has cast off anger, cast off selfishness, leaving behind every description
of bondage, without any fondness for name and form, free from everything: he cannot fall
into the way of passions.

2. Casting away rising anger, casting away the passions as soon as they show themselves, the
steadfast man casting away all ignorance, will find happiness in the perception of the truth.

3. If one has cast away anger, his sleep is peaceful; if one has cast away anger, he knows no
sorrow. Bhixus, destroy anger, which is the root of the poison; the elect declare that they
who have overcome it, are without sorrow.

4. "There is nothing better than to master oneâ€™s anger." This is a great saying? for pain comes
after anger, as it does when one has been burnt with fire.

5. He who is not chaste, without modesty, who gives way to anger, who is without restraint,
he who is thus subdued by passion, who is there that cares for him?l

6. He who has but the strength of the ignorant has a strength which is not one. It is not likely
that the fool who knows nothing of the law can attain perfection.

7. He who having strength is patient with those who are weak, him I call the most patient of
men, submitting always to the opinions of the weak.

8. He who, though he is lord over others? is patient with those who are weak, him I call the
most patient of men, submitting always to the opinions of the weak.

9. He who, having been chided, is patient though he be strong, him I call the most patient of
men, submitting always to the opinions of the weak.

10. He who, knowing that his enemy is angered, remains peaceful himself, preserves himself and
others from great dangers.
