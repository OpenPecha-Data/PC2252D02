to the world of the gods; this road, I declare, leads to the land of the gods.

2 (177). The avaricious go not to the world of the gods (devas), for the fool commends not charity:
they who are steadfast rejoice greatly in charity, also they enjoy happiness in the
other (world).

3. Faith is the greatest treasure of man in this (world)," for he who in this (world) observes
this law finds happiness: truth has the sweetest of all flavours, and to live according
to knowledge is, I declare, the best of lives.

4. If the wise man has faith in the doctrine of the Arhats that leads to nirvâṇa: and if he
listens respectfully, he will acquire that knowledge.

5. By earnestness one is saved from the ocean: and by faith from out the river; by earnestness
misery is removed ; by wisdom one is purified.

6. The Bhixu whose associate is faith and who is full of wisdom will cut off all his bonds for
the sake of attaining nirvâṇa.

7. The wise man who has real faith, morality, wisdom, and who does keep them present in his
mind, casts off all sins; he, I declare, is in the good way.

8. He who has perfect faith and morality, who casts off all avarice, and is liberal: wheresoever
he goes, he will be honoured.

9. The wise man in this world holds fast to faith and wisdom; these are his greatest treasures;
he casts aside all other riches.

10. He who likes to look on holy men, who delights to hear the Law, who has cast away the stains
of avarice, he must be called "faithful."
