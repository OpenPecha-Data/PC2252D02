11. One must lay up provisions of faith; for it is not possible to deprive one of his lot of
merit, and one need have no fear of the robbing of thieves. Happy are the Gramanas who have
acquired it, and happy is the wise man when he meets with (such) a Sramana.

12. Men give according to their inclination or according t o their faith. He whose mind is made
unhappy by what another eats and drinks finds no composure by day or night.

13 (250). He who has put an end to this (feeling), as he would cut off the top of a tala-tree:
finds composure by day and by night.

14. One must not associate with him who is without faith, for he is like a dried-up well, which,
if it be dug out, only gives muddy, dirty water.

15. Let the wise associate with the faithful, who are like a great and limpid river: like a
cool and untroubled lake.

16. The Muni is affected by those who have kindly feelings, or by those who have them not; have
then nothing to do with the unfaithful, and associate with the faithful.
